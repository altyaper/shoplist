## Todo-Challenge for Streams

This is just a simple web app that you can insert into your streams for doing a todo challenge of the stream, I normally use it with Fortnite, where I set a couple challenges so my viewers can know what I'm doing as challenges for the stream.

What I do is to cut the input and delete button from the screen.
